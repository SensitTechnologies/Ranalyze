# Objective

This is an auto-generated report for the following gas sensor test:

Characterize the SGX Lead-free Oxygen sensor's response to oxygen from 0 - 25% V.

# Procedure

Sensit Test Suite was used to design an automated test, utilizing two Cole-Parmer Mass flow Controllers, a Keysight Datalogger, and custom sensor interface hardware.  The custom hardware interfaced with the datalogger to power several sensors.

The test sequence applied one or more cycles of eleven gas concentration setpoints to the sensors, which were plumbed in series.

# Results

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE}
# Ensure required libraries are loaded.
loadLibraries()

# Read all of the test data within the working folder.
data = readTestData()

# If the data has "ref" and "sense" files, process as differential sensors.
if ((grepl("ref",tolower(attr(data[[1]],"filename"))) == TRUE) ||
    (grepl("sense",tolower(attr(data[[1]],"filename"))) == TRUE)){
  data = ref_process(data)
}

# Plot output vs. time.
PlotOutputVsTime(data)

# Calculate plateau values.
dataAveraged <- FindPlateus(data)

# Plot concentration vs. output for each sensor.
PlotConcentrationVsOutput(dataAveraged)
```

## Conclusion

The output of the sensor
